In this repository, I've created three (3) environments: Development, Testing, and Production. As well as six (6) branches and a basic workflow process.

The branches:
  (1) main-production - represents stable code that is ready for production.
  (2) development-branch - this is where development takes place.
  (3) features-branch - developers are expected to work on isolated and specific features here.
  (4) testing-branch - this is where code is tested before merging it with the branch release-production.
  (5) bug-fixes-branch - developers will fix the bugs detected at testing-branch here.
  (6) release-production - represents code that is ready for production and is ready to be merged with the main-production upon approval.
